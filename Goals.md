# Introduction #

This simple Qt program lets you easily edit CSV files. For best results
the first line should be headings and should have as many fields as the
longest line in the rest of the file, although neither of these are necessary.

Features
  * Allows quoted fields (although quotes not required for fields that do not contain commas)
  * Respects the two quote escape and now translates it both in and out
  * Allows selection of quote or comma character in options.

Version 1.0 released -- works under Linux and Windows. Untested elsewhere.
